## Code Info

### What is the point of this project?
Learning a language is not that difficult, what is difficult is to have an idea (obviously if you work you are plenty of things to do, but I can't work, I'm 15). So, when I finally found an opportunity to test what I know and to learn more I decided to make this app.

During the development time, I went very deep on `css` styling and api creatio, I also learned a new Library, `React.js`.

### Project History 
- Created the project on `express.js` only. 
- Found multiple bugs and ways to cheat on the game.
- Each challenge was on a route, so users could change and hack the game.
- Moved to `React.js` only.
- Added an API to interact with `mongoose` database using `express.js` and `axios`.
- Finished the Project 28/05/22
